			<h2>Semantic Elements</h2>
			<p>
				Semantic HTML tags are elements that convey meaning about the content they wrap, both to the browser and to
				developers,
				making the structure of the webpage more meaningful and easier to understand. They describe the purpose of the
				content
				rather than just how it looks.

			<h3>Improved Accessibility</h3>
			<p>
				Semantic HTML plays a crucial role in making websites more accessible to users with disabilities, particularly
				those who
				rely on assistive technologies like screen readers. These technologies use the structure provided by semantic
				tags to
				interpret and convey information about the pageâ€™s content and layout.
